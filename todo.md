# TODO - [ ] setup file manipulation commands (copy, move, delete, **rename**) in netrw

- [ ] add keymaps more keymaps
  - [ ] buffer management `<leader> + bd`
  - [ ] keymps for LSP
  - [ ] window management `ctrl + h/j/k/l`
- [ ] setup eslint and prettier in a way that when eslint and prettier config is available in the project, it uses that config to format. And when it is not there it should use prettier as a formatter.
- [ ] jsonls SchemaStore.nvim Note, this provides schemas for jsonls but still depends on lspconfig.
- [ ] setup treesitter
- [ ] add telescope

- [ ] session manager // check out vim -s Sesson
      // check out :h Session
      it could be better to save session every time on closing and have a shortcut that will open that session
      Also it's possible that the solution is in shada file
